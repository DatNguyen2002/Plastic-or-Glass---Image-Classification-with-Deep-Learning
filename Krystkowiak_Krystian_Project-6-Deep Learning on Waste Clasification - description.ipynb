    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project was building of **deep learning model** capable of **classifying glass and plastic** waste photos. A model with acceptable F1 score that can be part of more complex models and be utilised in modern sorting technologies. I worked with \"Images dataset for classifying household garbage\" dataset from Kaggle. After creating Logistic Regression baseline model, I trained, tested and tuned couple different deep learning models. My findings and best performing, refined CCN model I visualised and proposed during presentation, using Keynote and Tableau."

    "Over 2 billion tons of garbage we dump somewhere on the planet every year. Mismanaged **waste accumulates**, becoming part of ecosystem and inevitably leading to **environmental pollution and health issues** for humans.\n",
    "**Efficient waste management** is one of the great challenges of our time. **New technologies** can make life much easier for governments, companies and - last but not least - ordinary people. The spectrum of innovations ranges from smart waste containers to self-learning sorting technologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of steps in creating mentioned solutions is building and improvement of **machine learning model capable of classifying different types of waste**. This project is focusing on **glass and plastic** as those are more challenging parts of the problem."
